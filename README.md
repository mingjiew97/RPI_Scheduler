# RPI_Scheduler
RPI Scheduler is, as its name implies, an app that allows RPI students to view the schedules of all RPI “reservable” facilities from their phones. The app will take its information from the already existing electronic management system that manages all of RPI’s facility scheduling. Students will be able to view the schedule of any facility (included in the EMS) they choose, including individual timetables for each court within the facility and be able to swipe between dates in order to view future or past reservations. If a student finds a particular reservation interesting, they can tap on it to see further details including the event coordinator, the group, and the event name. This app will only be available on mobile devices for Android users.
